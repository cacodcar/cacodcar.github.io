Most, if not all, gradient descent algorithms are characterized by the number of times the function's gradient needs to be evaluated. A practical thing to do is look at how these are calculated and try to speed them up.

As a case study, I will look at speeding up the gradient for ridge regression. Ridge regression is the least-squares regression where the magnitude squared of the parameters are penalized in the regression. The following form is the mathematical description of ridge regression.

$$\min_x f(x) = ||y - Ax||^2 - \lambda ||x||^2$$

$$\nabla f(x) = -2A^T(y - Ax)+2\lambda x$$

We can see in the gradient expression multiple matrix operations are dependent on each other. The outer multiplication by $A^T$ cannot start before the residual term $y - Ax$ is calculated, and for various reasons, this quite inefficient. Due to the multiple multiplications by the same matrix in the expression, we lose out on data reuse (pieces of the matrix get loaded in from main memory only once). With the fact we are doing multiple operations and have performance degradation from intermediates. We can get around this problem. If we precompute some quantities, we can see a speed up by removing expensive temporaries and poor data use.

$$B = -2A^Ty$$

$$M = 2(A^TA+\lambda \mathcal{I})$$

$$\nabla  f(x) = -2A^T(y - Ax)+2\lambda x$$

$$\nabla  f(x) = -2A^Ty +2(A^TAx+\lambda \mathcal{I}) x$$

$$\nabla  f(x) = B + Mx$$

In python this is written as the following. 

```python

def textbook_grad(x, lambda_):
  return -2*A.T@(y - A@x)+2*lambda*x

def informed_grad(x, lambda_):
  return M@x+B

```

The time complexity of textbook formula is $\mathcal{O}(nm + mn + n + m) \approx \mathcal{O}(2nm)$, whereas the improved formula is $\mathcal{O}(m^2 + m) \approx \mathcal{O}(m^2)$, in the case that $m < n$ then we would have an asymptotic speedup of $~2n/m$. But due to the cache structure of the CPU, reducing the memory footprint of the matrices required to calculate the gradient can massively increase the performance (e.g., everything fitting into L2 vs. L3 cache). 

These terms do have to be precomputed at the start, but this is inconsequential in my experience. For a matrix, A for size n by m, the asymptotic complexity of creating these is $\mathcal{O}(nm^2)$, where n is the number of observations and m is the number of features. While the asymptotic analysis might look detrimental, for practically size systems (n < ~20,000 and m <  ~1000), this system makes sense, I will cover this momentarily. These sorts of constraints on the systems cover many practical problems in engineering, science, and statistics.

For a ridge regression problem with 10,000 observations and 500 features, the timing differences between textbook and informed gradient are quite shocking.

```python
%timeit textbook_grad(x, lambda_)
%timeit informed_grad(x, lambda_)
```

```python
textbook_grad -> 11.4 ms ± 211 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100 loops each)
informed_grad -> 11.2 µs ± 978 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100000 loops each)
```

We have an almost 1000x speedup over the original form. In a setting where rapidly evaluating the gradient, this is a significant improvement. I will show this speed up in action by comparing the times for a Nesterov based gradient descent algorithm with and without fast gradient.

```python 

def nesterov_desc(x,lambda_,  df, L, max_iter = 10000) -> list:
    y_0 = x.copy()
    y_1 = x.copy()
    x_0 = x.copy()
    x_1 = x.copy()
    
    x_list = list()
    
    for i in range(max_iter):
        #compute grad_f
        grad = df(y_0, lambda_)
        
        #update x_{t+1}
        x_1 = y_0 - (1.0/L)*grad
        #update y_{t+1}
        y_1 = 2*x_1 -x_0
        
        #reset momentum if no longer going down
        if grad.T@(x_1 - x_0) > 0:
            y_0 = x_0.copy()
            y_1 = x_0.copy()
            x_0 = x_0.copy()
            x_1 = x_0.copy()
        
        #step forward
        y_0 = y_1
        x_0 = x_1
        
        #add step to list
        x_list.append(x_0)
        
    return x_list
```

We can now benchmark the resulting algorithm. The strength of the informed gradient can be seen here. Clearly the matrix-matrix multiplication is cheap, compared to the time savings we have here (the time to compute M and B are ~10 ms).

```python
%timeit p = nesterov_desc(x_0, 1, textbook_grad, L)
%timeit q = nesterov_desc(x_0, 1, informed_grad, L)
```

```python
textbook_grad -> 12.1 s ± 403 ms per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1 loop each)
informed_grad -> 22.3 ms ± 1.04 ms per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10 loops each)
```

These sorts of speed ups don't come every day, and we must take hold of them when possible. I should stress, that the evaluated gradients at every point are the same, that the difference we are seeing here is only on the speed up of computing the gradient.
