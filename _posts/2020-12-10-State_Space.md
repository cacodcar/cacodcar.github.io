With model predictive control, a mathematic optimization problem is solved to find the 'optimal' control needed to drive the system to a specified set point. A model of the system is embedded into the constraints of the optimization problem in the following way.

$$\min \sum_0^nx^T_kQx_k + \sum_0^{n-1}u^T_kRu_k$$

$$\text{s.t.  } x_{k+1} = g(x_k, u_k)$$

$$x_k \in \mathcal{X}$$

$$u_k \in \mathcal{U}$$


However, this leads to a problem. If our function 'g' is nonlinear, this becomes a much harder problem to solve in general. For most control applications, the time it takes to solve the problem is a significant constraint. If a process needs an action every second and takes 5 seconds to solve the optimization problem, this is not helpful. To reduce the time to solve the optimization problem, we need to find a simpler model to embedded into it.

One of the most popular model types is the State Space model. It is linear is separable for the state and input parameters, and the discrete time-invariant form takes the following form.


$$x_{k+1} = Ax_k + Bu_k$$

While this does not and cannot include nonlinearities from the original system, the state-space model usually does a good job for many systems.
