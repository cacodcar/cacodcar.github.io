This post will talk about particle swarm optimization. This technique is usually used to solve non-convex optimization problems where one does not have the objective function in closed form. Particle swarm optimization is a relatively simple technique that is based on the flock dynamics of birds. The algorithm is relatively simple in that We generate a swarm of particles in the domain then make them swarm towards the 'best bird.' While each particle in the swarm is directed to go towards the best particle in the swarm and the 'best position' location, it also has a search for the local space along the way. The following gif from Wikipedia gives a visual overview of what is happening.

I have implemented the basic PSO algorithm in python 3.7 here. This is not meant to be fast but explain the individual parts. The last 4 parameters are hyperparameters and can be tuned to the specific problem at hand. This can be altered to include constraints and other features.

```python

def PSO_numpy(f, n_particles, lower, upper, max_iter = 100, w = .9, phi_1 = .3, phi_2 = .5, learning_rate = .1):
    
    bounds_range = upper - lower
    
    best_particle_obj = float('inf')
    best_swarm_obj = float('inf') 
    
    best_particle_index = -1
    best_swarm_location = 0*upper
    
    n_dims = lower.size
    
    particles = numpy.zeros((n_particles, n_dims))
    velocities = numpy.zeros((n_particles, n_dims))
    
    #initialize the particles
    
    for i in range(n_particles):
        particles[i] = numpy.random.uniform(lower, upper)
        velocities[i] = numpy.random.uniform(-bounds_range, bounds_range)
        
        p_obj = f(particles[i])
        
        if p_obj < best_particle_obj :
            best_particle_index = i
            best_particle_obj = p_obj
            best_swarm_obj = p_obj
            best_swarm_location = particles[i].copy()
        
    for i in range(max_iter):
        
        for p in range(n_particles):
            
            r_p = numpy.random.rand(n_dims)
            r_g = numpy.random.rand(n_dims) 
            
            velocities[p] = w*velocities[p] + phi_1*r_p*(particles[best_particle_index] - particles[p]) + phi_2*r_g*(best_swarm_location - particles[p]) + ()
            
            particles[p] = particles[p] + learning_rate*velocities[p]
            
            particle_obj = f(particles[p])
            
            if particle_obj < best_particle_obj:
                
                best_particle_obj = particle_obj
                best_particle_index = p
                
                if particle_obj < best_swarm_obj:
                    
                    best_swarm_location = particles[p].copy()
                    best_swarm_obj = particle_obj
        
    return best_swarm_location, best_swarm_obj

```

One of the larges packages for the python ecosystem is Pyswarm. It is a good package with many different PSO algorithms implemented not only for a continuous problem but also for discrete problems, such as integer optimization. Here is an example from the page https://pythonhosted.org/pyswarm/ where we are trying to optimize an A-frame truss. 

```python

import numpy as np
from pyswarm import pso

# Define the objective (to be minimize)
def weight(x, *args):
    H, d, t = x
    B, rho, E, P = args
    return rho*2*np.pi*d*t*np.sqrt((B/2)**2 + H**2)

# Setup the constraint functions
def yield_stress(x, *args):
    H, d, t = x
    B, rho, E, P = args
    return (P*np.sqrt((B/2)**2 + H**2))/(2*t*np.pi*d*H)

def buckling_stress(x, *args):
    H, d, t = x
    B, rho, E, P = args
    return (np.pi**2*E*(d**2 + t**2))/(8*((B/2)**2 + H**2))

def deflection(x, *args):
    H, d, t = x
    B, rho, E, P = args
    return (P*np.sqrt((B/2)**2 + H**2)**3)/(2*t*np.pi*d*H**2*E)

def constraints(x, *args):
    strs = yield_stress(x, *args)
    buck = buckling_stress(x, *args)
    defl = deflection(x, *args)
    return [100 - strs, buck - strs, 0.25 - defl]

# Define the other parameters
B = 60  # inches
rho = 0.3  # lb/in^3
E = 30000  # kpsi (1000-psi)
P = 66  # kip (1000-lbs, force)
args = (B, rho, E, P)

# Define the lower and upper bounds for H, d, t, respectively
lb = [10, 1, 0.01]
ub = [30, 3, 0.25]

xopt, fopt = pso(weight, lb, ub, f_ieqcons=constraints, args=args)

# The optimal input values are approximately
#     xopt = [29, 2.4, 0.06]
# with function values approximately
#     weight          = 12 lbs
#     yield stress    = 100 kpsi (binding constraint)
#     buckling stress = 150 kpsi
#     deflection      = 0.2 in

```
